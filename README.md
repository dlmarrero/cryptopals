# Assignment

Spend time exploring one of the choices above. Explore, tinker, experiment, read, learn.
Write a 5 to 6 page paper (5 or 6 pages of text, not including figures etc.), 12 point font,
single spaced. The length can be extended beyond 5 to 6 pages to include code, figures,
pictures and diagrams. However, the total length of the paper shall remain under 12 pages,
including the title page. In this paper write about:
• What you did (which option you chose: 1, 2 or 3)
• How many hours you spent
• What you learned
• How what you learned in class reinforced, or not, what you learned in this assignment

Remember to include your name and the number of hours you spent. Don’t assume your
reader (me) has familiarity with the protocols, terminology and acronyms used in your
sources. This is an opportunity for you to explain these things. The grading rubrics are
intentionally not defined. I’m looking to you to impress me; teach me something new or
something I don’t know. Think of this assignment as an independent study.

Format of your paper: Start with the provided template.

To submit for grading: A single PDF file of your paper that contains all of the content of your
paper. If you submit your paper in any other format, you will receive 0 points.
Note: It is super important to do your own writing. You will find that in your professional life
you will do a great deal of technical writing as an engineer. Citing up to 10 or less web
resources or on-line papers is fine for this assignment, but you must indicate your citations as
other people’s work. See the paper template provided to you to use as a starting point for
your paper. Points may be taken off for any un-cited web references.

## Lessons Learned

What did I learn. Is this reinforced by what we learned in class?

* Set 1
	* Challenge 1
		* Researched and learned about the underlying implementation of base64 to roll my own. Will use the built-in libraries going forward
	* Challenge 6
		* Must get hamming distance over as many chunks as possible to get an
		  accurate keysize score
